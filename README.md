## 🎯 Objective  

The primary goal of this project is to extract text articles from the provided URLs and compute analytical variables, including sentiment and readability metrics.  

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used  

- 🐍 Python  
- 📚 Libraries: `BeautifulSoup`, `Selenium`, `Scrapy`, `pandas`, `numpy`, and others.  

---

## 📋 Project Workflow  

### 🔍 Data Extraction  

1. **Input**: The URLs are provided in `Input.xlsx`.  
2. **Extraction**:  
   - Articles are scraped using Python-based tools (`BeautifulSoup`, `Selenium`, or `Scrapy`).  
   - Only the article title and text are extracted (excluding website headers, footers, and other non-content elements).  
3. **Output**: The extracted content is saved in `.txt` files named using the `URL_ID`.  

### 📊 Data Analysis  

1. **Text Analysis**:  
   - Compute variables such as sentiment scores, readability indices, and word statistics.  
2. **Output Format**:  
   - The results are saved in a structured format as defined in `Output Data Structure.xlsx`.  

---

## 📈 Output Variables  

The analysis produces the following variables:  

- **POSITIVE SCORE**: Measure of positive sentiment.  
- **NEGATIVE SCORE**: Measure of negative sentiment.  
- **POLARITY SCORE**: Sentiment polarity.  
- **SUBJECTIVITY SCORE**: Extent of subjectivity.  
- **AVG SENTENCE LENGTH**  
- **PERCENTAGE OF COMPLEX WORDS**  
- **FOG INDEX**  
- **AVG NUMBER OF WORDS PER SENTENCE**  
- **COMPLEX WORD COUNT**  
- **WORD COUNT**  
- **SYLLABLE PER WORD**  
- **PERSONAL PRONOUNS**  
- **AVG WORD LENGTH**
